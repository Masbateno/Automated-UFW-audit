  - Recommendations automatically added for WARN and ALERT entries in detailed mode
  - Log header now includes “Audit initiated by” field
  - Final log section with summary and recommended actions
- Dependency check improved:
  - Distinguishes mandatory (`ufw`) and optional (`ss` / `netstat`) dependencies
  - Provides clear install instructions for missing dependencies
- Listening port analysis now:
  - Uses `ss` or `netstat` safely depending on availability
  - Verbose and detailed logs separated
  - Counts listening ports and highlights public exposure
- `AUDIT_REQUESTED` flag introduced to track when an audit is actually being performed
- `is_detailed()` helper function added to simplify detailed-log checks
- `finalize_log()` function added to neatly append audit summary and recommendations
- Improved modularity and readability without changing any scoring or existing feature
- Maintains full backward compatibility with v0.2 behavior
